# Welcome

I'm Numaan — an engineer interersted (and studying) Security Engineering and AppSec.

This site is a running log of:
- Security writeups  
- AI-assisted tooling experiments  
- AppSec + cloud security projects  
- Hands-on learning as I move deeper into the field  

Everything here is real, practical, and based on what I’m building day to day.
