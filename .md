# About Me

I'm a QA Test Automation Engineer interested in Security Engineering & Cybersecurity.

I work with:
- .NET / C#
- Cloud (AWS)
- Automation pipelines
- Crypto and secure software development

I’m a month from completing my M.S. in Cybersecurity at NYU (December 2025).

This site documents the actual work I’m doing to break into AppSec and Product Security.
